# ReWrite

Re-write is an application for generating letters, CV in a short duration. It also takes care of making the output as per user requirements as it provides various samples to the user to choose from.


## Software and API 

### Andriod Studio

Android Studio is used to compile all the code together to create an application. Android studio has multiple libraries which can be imported in your java file. Apart from the most common libraries, we have used Spannable, SpannableStringBuilder, StyleSpan which helps in styling the font for example we have edited some text as italics  and some as bold. With the help of toast function, we have made it easier for the user to understand if something is wrong. More type of libraries have been included such as PageAdapter, LayoutInflater etc. With the help of such libraries we have successfully implemented slide view. A user can simply slide around the app jump from source activity to multiple activities. We have also implemented scroll view which allows the user to stay on one activity and enter multiple inputs rather moving to different activities. The implementation of these view wherever required have made the application user friendly, as the user will not run into any hassles at the time of creating their letter or CV. We have implemented spinner widget which displays a drop-down menu, allowing user to choose from multiple options.

Android Studio allows the creator to ask for specific hardware permission from the user.

In our app we have asked the user to allow the application to store a .pdf file in the local storage of user's mobile phone.
